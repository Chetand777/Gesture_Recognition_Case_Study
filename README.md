# Problem Statement

As a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions, our goal is to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognize five different gestures performed by the user. This feature will empower users to control the TV without using a remote.

## Gestures and Actions

- **Thumbs up:** Increase the volume.
- **Thumbs down:** Decrease the volume.
- **Left swipe:** 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds.
- **Right swipe:** 'Jump' forward 10 seconds.
- **Stop:** Pause the movie.

This innovative gesture recognition system aims to enhance user experience and bring a new level of convenience to interacting with smart TVs.
